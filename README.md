- First you have to download this codebase. For that give the following command, by going to what ever directory(folder) which you like to download this code base. <br/>
  `git clone link`

- run `flutter pub get`

- debug project without errors

- After downloading the code base, create a your own git branch to work. For that give the bellow command.<br />
  `git branch <your name>`

- After creating the branch to go in to that branch give the following command. <br />

  `git commit -m "<commit message line>"`

- Then push the code in to your remote branch by giving the following command<br />
  `git push -u origin <branch name which you created>`

- After pushing the code in to global repository, now you can go to the github.com website and make a pull request. For that;<br />
    - when creating a pull request make the pull request from your branch to 'dev' branch. Not to 'main' branch.<br />
      `Ex: hansaka => dev`

- To get an updated codebase from the dev branch<br />
  `git checkout <your branch name>`<br />
  `git fetch origin`<br />
  `git merge origin/dev`
